# Image Attribute Modifier

Addon for modifying image width and height. 

# How to use

Right click on an image in editor, and click on 'Image Attribute'

# Difference from Image-Resizer

### Pros

* This add-on uses html img height and width attributes to resize images, so there is no loss of quality.
* You can modify width and height individually

### Cons

* Does not automatically resize images on paste.
